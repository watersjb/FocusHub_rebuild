## What Files to Upload

Everything in the `focushub-build` folder:
- index.html ✅
- assets/ folder ✅
- All .svg files ✅
- netlify.toml ✅
- render.yaml ✅
- All .md files ✅
- .gitignore ✅

**Just drag the whole folder contents.**

## Your URLs After Deploy

**Netlify gives you:**
`https://focushub-abc123.netlify.app`

**Render gives you:**
`https://focushub.onrender.com`

Both work perfectly. Choose whichever you prefer.

## If You Get Stuck

**Can't upload to GitHub?**
- Use GitHub Desktop app instead
- Or try Netlify Drop (no GitHub needed): https://app.netlify.com/drop

**Deploy button doesn't work?**
- Go to netlify.com → "Add new site" → "Import from Git"
- Select your repo
- Click deploy

**Still stuck?**
- Google: "how to upload to github"
- Or use Netlify Drop (literally drag and drop)

---

## Time Required

- Upload to GitHub: **2 minutes**
- Click deploy button: **10 seconds**
- Wait for deployment: **30 seconds**

**Total: 3 minutes from now to live app.**

## No GitHub? Use This Instead

https://app.netlify.com/drop

Drag `focushub-build` folder → Get live URL

**Even simpler. 30 seconds total.**
