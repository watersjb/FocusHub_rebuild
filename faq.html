                <div class="faq-question">What makes FocusHub different from other productivity apps?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    FocusHub doesn't pile on endless to-do lists. It limits your focus to NOW. Energy-based timer. Strategic buckets. Tough-love accountability. Built specifically for ADHD brains that wander but still want to win.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Is this really for ADHD?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Yes. Built by someone with ADHD who tried every other system and watched them fail. FocusHub accounts for time blindness, decision fatigue, hyperfocus crashes, and the constant pull of distractions. It's not inspiration. It's scaffolding.
                </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What's the tough-love approach?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Your Daily Pace GPS tracks performance and calls out patterns. Not a cheerleader. Not a therapist. A performance coach. If you're logging 8 distractions by noon, it tells you. If you've done 6 sprints with zero output, it asks where the work is. Accountability, not coddling.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What are faith-grounded reflections?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Daily reflections draw from virtue ethics and spiritual wisdom traditions. They're not gentle affirmations. They're firm direction rooted in centuries of teaching on discipline, duty, and purpose. Standard tier includes Catholic-based reflections presented generically. Premium unlocks multi-faith options.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Can I use the free tier forever?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Yes. Lite tier is fully functional forever. Energy-based timer, task management, brain dump, distraction logging, daily grading, progress tracking. No time limits. No feature nagging. If you want reflections, streak tracking, and pattern recognition, upgrade to Standard.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What about my data and privacy?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Everything lives in your browser's local storage. No cloud sync. No data collection. No tracking. Your tasks, your grades, your distractions—all yours. Can't be accessed without your device. If you clear browser data, it's gone. That's by design.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What if I miss a day?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Your tasks persist. Your sprint streak resets. No guilt spirals. No shame notifications. Just start fresh. Discipline isn't perfection. It's getting back up. FocusHub doesn't punish gaps—it tracks forward momentum.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How does the Daily Pace GPS calculate my target?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Your target is your planned sprints × 1.5, with a minimum baseline of 4. Why the 50% buffer? ADHD reality: tasks take longer than estimated, distractions happen, breaks are needed, context switching costs time. If you estimate 6 sprints of work, you'll probably need 9 actual sprints to complete it. The buffer keeps your target realistic but challenging—not fantasy. The system accounts for how ADHD brains actually work, not how productivity gurus say they should work.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How do I get a license code?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Purchase links coming soon. Once you have a code, click any "Purchase" button on the pricing tiers, enter your code in the license modal, and your tier unlocks immediately. Codes validate client-side for now. Backend validation coming.
